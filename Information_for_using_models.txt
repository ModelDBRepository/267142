This ZIP file contains all models used for the manuscript

The models are preperated in folders according to the figure layout of the manuscript:
"Modelling the spatial and temporal constrains of the GABAergic influence on neuronal excitability"
by Aniello Lombardi, H.J. Luhmann and W. Kilb
in PLos COmputational Biology, 2021

For each folder all files required are included, however, before running the simulations
the program mknrndll must be excecuted to generate the required dll library.

In most cases the simulations should run upon starting the "Start_Program_XXX.hoc" file.
Only for the generation of the Figures in Fig1 the cell the hoc and sses files are manually loaded to the GUI.

In many cases (e.g. Fig. 5) one parameter must be changed by hand to allow starting parralel processes in Windows Multicore computers
In these instances the procedure is explained in detail in the comments and the manually adaptable parameters are given in the comment lines.
